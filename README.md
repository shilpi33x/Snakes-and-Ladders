# Snakes-and-Ladders
## Singleplayer Snakes and Ladders board game using Unity

Completely random dice rolls.\
Graphics and UI are intentionally low-effort. I focused solely on the core gameplay.\
Not the best approach for a board game by far- very imited scope and won't be useful for any other games. Wanted to implement it somewhere just for the sake of it.
